            <h2>#Huddle1 Is for You</h2>
            <p>You have been teaching exercise and team-building skills to your clients for years. It is time you teamed up
                with other professionals in your field and shared knowledge with them in a fun, relaxed environment. #Huddle1
                will provide this opportunity to you. </p>
            <h3>Meet, Learn, and Be Merry</h3>
            <p>The main highlight of #Huddle1 will be formal talks by industry experts about the latest training techniques
                and sports gear. You could give a formal talk yourself if you satisfy the requirements of our
                <a href="">Trainers Talk program</a>.</p>
            <p>Be assured that the formal talks will be immensely enjoyable. The Trainers Talk program will ensure that not
                even an ounce of boredom creeps into the talks.</p>
            <p>All the formal knowledge sharing at the conference will be interspersed with fun activities that will entertain,
                exhilarate, and soothe you. During these activities, we will help you break the ice, if any exists, and form
                lasting friendships.</p>
